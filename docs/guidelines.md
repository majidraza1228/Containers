## Guidelines for the session

* It will be __only an in-person session__ and we won't support online
* It is a __must to complete__  [study material](study_materials.md) before coming to the session; As we feel, session will be obsolete otherwise
* __Add your questions here__ <https://app.sli.do/event/uie3pyej>. Trainer will answer it at the end of session. 

<code>We like interactive session but experience show that questions at the end of session is better as many questions will be answered in the subsequent slides.</code>

* __Please mindful about Trainer break__. Please do not engage him/her with questions during break. He needs energy for next topic :)
* Please come __prepared with your questions__. This allows us to engage in a more effective way possible
